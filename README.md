Nefarious LinkedIn
==================

This extension is in response to a blog post written by myself. The original
blog post can be found [here](https://www.nymeria.io/blog/linkedins-war-on-email-finder-extensions-like-nymeria).

With this extension you can easily see which browser extensions LinkedIn is
scanning your web browser for. If you happen to have any of the extensions
installed there's a good chance your LinkedIn account would be restricted by
LinkedIn at some point.
